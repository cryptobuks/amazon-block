# amazon-block

A WordPress plugin that provides 'Amazon' block for Gutenberg editor.
This is a wrapper of a popular plugin, [AmazonJS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazonjs/).

## Requirements

- WordPress
- PHP 5.6 or higher
  - This plugin may work on PHP 5.2+, but we do not officially support 5.5 or lower.

[Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) is also required to use AmazonBlock.
If Gutenberg is not installed, this plugin falls back to classic AmazonJS.
